## What was already provisioned

When this repo was created, the following infrastructure was bootstrapped
automatically — you do not need to create any of it:

**GitHub**
- Repository `Juiceco-io/company-homepage` with branches `main`, `dev`, `qa`
- Branch protections on all three branches (1 approving review, CODEOWNERS `@sauerm1`)
- GitHub Environments: `dev` (deploys from `dev`), `qa` (deploys from `qa`), `prod` (deploys from `main`)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs Lint, Typecheck & Build on push/PR
- `.github/workflows/promote-guardrail.yml` — enforces `qa → main` only promotions
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — `* @sauerm1`

**AWS (one account per environment)**
| GitHub Environment | AWS Account | Branch |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| `dev` | `company-homepage-dev` | `dev` |
| `qa` | `company-homepage-qa` | `qa` |
| `prod` | `company-homepage-prd` | `main` |

Each AWS account has:
- An OIDC provider configured for GitHub Actions
- An IAM role named `github-actions-deployer` (trusted only for this repo + its matching environment)
- An IAM role named `alfred-readonly` (for read-only platform tooling access)

**GitHub Environment variables (pre-populated per environment)**
| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Set per environment |
| `AWS_DEPLOYER_ROLE_ARN` | `arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:role/github-actions-deployer` |

Reference them in workflows as `$\{{ vars.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}` and
`$\{{ vars.AWS_DEPLOYER_ROLE_ARN }}`. Do not hardcode account IDs or role ARNs.

## How to deploy

Deployments use the shared reusable workflow in `github-infra`. You write a
thin caller workflow per environment; the platform handles OIDC auth.

### Minimal caller workflow example (deploy to dev)

Create `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy — Dev

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to dev
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    uses: Juiceco-io/github-infra/.github/workflows/app-deploy.yml@main
    with:
      environment: dev
      aws_role_to_assume: $\{{ vars.AWS_DEPLOYER_ROLE_ARN }}
      aws_region: us-east-1
      working_directory: .
      deploy_command: npm run deploy:dev
    secrets: inherit
```

Repeat for `qa` (trigger on `qa` branch, `environment: qa`, `deploy_command: npm run deploy:qa`)
and `prod` (trigger on `main` branch, `environment: prod`, `deploy_command: npm run deploy:prod`).

### Reusable workflow inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `aws_role_to_assume` | yes | — | Always use `$\{{ vars.AWS_DEPLOYER_ROLE_ARN }}` |
| `deploy_command` | yes | — | Your app's deploy script, e.g. `npm run deploy:dev` |
| `environment` | no | `dev` | Must match the GitHub Environment name |
| `aws_region` | no | `us-east-1` | |
| `working_directory` | no | `.` | |
| `node_version` | no | `20` | |
| `install_command` | no | `npm ci` | |
| `build_command` | no | _(empty)_ | Optional pre-deploy build step |

## Git branching model

```
feature branches
      ↓  PR to dev
    dev  ──── deploys to dev AWS account ────▶ dev env
      ↓  PR to qa (Mark approves)
     qa  ──── deploys to qa AWS account  ────▶ qa env
      ↓  PR to main (Mark approves; must come from qa)
    main ──── deploys to prd AWS account ────▶ prod env
```

- `main` IS the production branch — there is no separate `prd` branch
- Only `qa` can open PRs to `main` (enforced by the promote-guardrail workflow)
- Only `@sauerm1` can approve and merge PRs

## Platform conventions

### AWS
- **No long-lived AWS access keys** — OIDC only. Never create `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets.
- **Secrets**: use AWS Secrets Manager (not SSM Parameter Store)
- **Static sites / Next.js exports**: prefer CloudFront + S3
- **Serverless**: prefer Lambda + DynamoDB on-demand
- **Public-facing apps**: WAF required (`AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet` + rate limiting)
- **Apps with user accounts**: use Cognito — never roll your own JWT validation
- **Resource tagging**: always tag with `app = "company-homepage"`, `env = <env>`, `team = <team>`
- **Budget alerts**: $50/mo dev, $500/mo prd (provisioned automatically)
- **`api-service` apps**: must expose `GET /health` endpoint

### GitHub Actions / secrets
- App-specific secrets (API keys, webhook tokens, etc.) are added via `gh secret set` after bootstrap — never committed to the repo or to `github-infra`
- The `github-infra` reusable workflows must be allowed in this repo's Actions settings (Settings → Actions → General → Allow Juiceco-io/github-infra workflows)

### Observability (required baseline for all apps)
- Emit structured JSON logs with fields: `traceId`, `appSlug`, `env`
- CloudWatch Alarm: 5xx rate > 1% over 5 minutes
- X-Ray tracing on Lambda and API Gateway
- Production additions: CloudWatch dashboard, synthetic canary, saved Log Insights queries
